    <h1>The Story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
      an hour now. On her desk,lying beetween the copies of <i>Nature</i>.
      <i>New Scientist</i>, and all The other scientific journals her work had
      appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road </cite>.
      It had been Molly's  favourite book since college, and the longer
       she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>

    <p>She had spent the last 10 years in this room,
      sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
      proclaming that  <q>Work is the refuge of
      people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although
      many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
      the secrects of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic asid">DNA</abbr>
      ,to be an outstanding achivement,Molly<em>did</em> think she had
      something better to do.</p>
